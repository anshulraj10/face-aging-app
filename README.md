## Overview
The **Face Aging App** is a deep learning-powered web application built with **Streamlit** that allows users to visualize how they might look older or younger. By combining tools like **Stable Diffusion inpainting** and facial masking techniques, this app seamlessly modifies facial features while preserving realism.

This project serves as both a functional demonstration of face transformation technology and a personal portfolio piece showcasing model integration, preprocessing pipelines, and UI deployment.

## Features
- Upload an image and visualize aged or de-aged versions
- Facial region detection using custom facial landmark logic
- Image masking and inpainting with diffusion models
- Optimized for local inference
- Lightweight architecture with optional model quantization and pruning

## How It Works
1. **Upload Image**: The user uploads a frontal facial photo.
2. **Face Detection**: `face_mask.py` identifies facial landmarks using custom logic.
3. **Mask Creation**: A region to be aged is masked while preserving background.
4. **Transformation**: `pipeline.py` applies a pretrained diffusion-based model to inpaint the masked region.
5. **Stable Diffusion Inpainting**: We use the `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting` model from Hugging Face. This model takes a masked image, a binary mask, and a text prompt to guide the transformation. The prompt is necessary to instruct the model on what kind of inpainting is desiredâ€”e.g., "make this person look 20 years older". The combination of the visual input and prompt allows the model to generate age-progressed or regressed images with realistic textures and details.
6. **Quantization (Optional)**: For optimized deployment, `quantize_prune.py` enables lightweight inference.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-aging-app.git
cd face-aging-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Streamlit** for frontend
- **Stable Diffusion (via diffusers)** for image transformation
- **Torch + Transformers** for deep learning
- **OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib** for preprocessing and image operations

## Limitations
- Performance is hardware-dependent (no GPU = slower inference)
- Best results with clear, frontal face images
- May not generalize to extreme expressions or occluded faces

## Future Work
- Add option to control aging intensity
- Enable webcam support
- Expand to include hairstyle or lighting style changes
- Deploy to HuggingFace Spaces or Streamlit Cloud
